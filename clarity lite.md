# Privacy Policy for NODUS Lite

**Effective Date:** December 30, 2025

Welcome to **Clarity core**. We are committed to protecting your privacy while providing an inspiring and aesthetic experience. This policy outlines how we handle data and connectivity.

## 1. Local Data Processing (Mood Tracking)
The core of Clarity core is designed to be private and secure:
* **Mood Entries:** Any text or mood you enter into the application is processed **locally on your device**. 
* **No Mood Storage:** We do not collect, upload, or store your personal thoughts or mood history on any external servers. This data remains strictly in your device's temporary memory.

## 2. Online Wallpaper Gallery
Clarity core features an online gallery to provide you with high-quality, diverse aesthetic backgrounds:
* **Internet Connectivity:** The app requires an internet connection to fetch and display the latest wallpaper collections from our servers.
* **No Tracking:** While the app connects to the internet to download images, we **do not track** which specific wallpapers you view or download, and we do not link this activity to your identity.
* **Caching:** Some images may be cached locally on your device to improve performance and reduce data usage for future sessions.

## 3. Data Collection and Third Parties
* **No Personal Information:** We do not require you to create an account, provide an email address, or share any personal identifiers to use NODUS Lite.
* **No Analytics/Ads:** This Lite version does not use third-party tracking pixels or targeted advertising networks that monitor your behavior across other apps.

## 4. Required Permissions
To provide its full functionality, NODUS Lite may ask for:
* **Internet Access:** Necessary to fetch and update the wallpaper and background gallery.
* **Storage/Media Access:** Required if you choose to save a generated design or a downloaded wallpaper directly to your device's gallery.

## 5. Security
Since your personal mood entries never leave your device, your data is as secure as your phone itself. We encourage users to maintain standard device security (biometrics or passcodes).

## 6. Children's Privacy
Clarity core does not collect any personal data and is safe for use by individuals of all ages. We do not knowingly interact with or collect information from children under the age of 13.
